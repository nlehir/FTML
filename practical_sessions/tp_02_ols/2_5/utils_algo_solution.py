    """
    Statistical evaluation of the generalization error of the OLS estimator.
    The generalization error is an expected value. We approximate this
    expected value by sampling some data, computing test errors, and repeting the simulation a
    number of times that is approximately sufficient to observe convergence.

    n_repetitions times, do:
        - Draw output vector y_train, according to the linear model, fixed
        design setup.
        - compute the corresponding OLS estimators. Each OLS estimator will be
          different.
        - generate a y_test in order to have an estimation of the generalization error of
        this estimator

    Importantly, our expected value is taken over the whole data generation
    process. As the OLS estimator depends on the y_train, several OLS
    estimators will be computed.

    In the fixed design setting, which is a specific case, y_train and y_test
    contain the same number of samples, equal to n_train here.

    Parameters:
        n_train (int): number of samples in the train dataset
        d (int): dimension of each sample (number of features)
        n_repetitions (int): number of simulations run in order to average the
